Project Goal:

    Combining two linked lists together 
    Condition: Both lists are sorted
    Outcome: a final sorted list containing elements from both input lists.

Class Node:
        A Node Object holding a value and a reference to another Node.

Class MyLinkedList:
        A linkedlist structure : chaining nodes to each other
        with insert, show and retrieving the head Node

Class Driver:
        This class contains the main method to run the program.
        Also, the main point of this piece is the static method
        which combines 2 linkedlists together.
